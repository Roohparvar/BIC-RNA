# BIC-RNA

**BIC-RNA** is a repository for designing RNA sequences to solve the inverse RNA folding problem. This tool takes a secondary RNA structure in dot-bracket notation as input and suggests the RNA sequence required to achieve that structure.

## Project Overview
The inverse RNA folding problem involves identifying an RNA sequence that will fold into a specified secondary structure. This repository includes code and resources to facilitate the design of RNA sequences with desired secondary structures.

### Example
This tool analyzes the given RNA structure in dot-bracket format and returns an RNA sequence that, when folded, can form the secondary structure specified by the user.

## Features
- Input RNA secondary structure in dot-bracket notation
- Output RNA sequence optimized to match the given structure

## Raw Data
The raw data used in this project is downloaded from the bpRNA-1m Version 1.0, which is a database of single-molecule RNA secondary structures annotated by bpRNA. You can access the database [here](https://bprna.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/).
